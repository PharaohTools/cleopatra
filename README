A Coding Puzzle -
-------------------
The task at hand was as follows...

We are going to focus on User Management and ACL.

We want to be able to log in on an backend domain and access a blank hello page world on success. On failure,
we need to be told that we can’t login. At this stage Login is only PHP.
Password must be encrypted. User can create an account with name / email / password / creationdate / lastlogintime

Once logged In, we want to display the username and a log out functionality and a menu with 3 pages. (User / Group /
Results ). Below a “hello world” is enough. The user need to be able to navigate between this pages. If a
non-authorized user tries to access Group, he needs to be told off. Only the user with the ADMIN role can see and
interact with the menu Group.

Each user can belong to X groups and each group can have X roles. Each user can have X roles too.

Key points :
-          Think extensibility, more functionalities will come
-          100% test coverage on unit level. Report embedded
-          Fat model / Thin controller
-          Cucumber test coverage. Report embedded
-          Think fluid interface.
-          Think inheritance
-          Think forward

Bear in mind that this code will evolve, so code wisely or you will live with your mistakes J
It needs to be MVC.
Php code is in php file. Html code in html file.
No framework at all. At this stage, no javascript too.



-------------------------------------------------------------------

The build is ready to pass the following

1) functional tests - cucumber
2) php md tests - phpmd
3) phpunit tests - phpunit

All available in the build/config folder, just run execute.php
