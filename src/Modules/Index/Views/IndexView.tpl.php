PTConfigure - Pharaoh Tools
---------------------------------------

Configuration Management, Systems Automation and Infrastructure by Code in PHP. Provision your boxes manually or
with an Operating System agnostic method of ensuring environment stability.

This tool is for provisioning software and configurations to your boxes. You can set up complex provisions to your
systems with one or two PHP files, or quickly set up cloud friendly deployment patterns.

PTConfigure is modular. object oriented and extendible, you can pretty easily write your own module if you want
functionality we haven't yet covered. Feel free to submit us pull requests.

This is part of the Pharaoh Tools suite, which covers Configuration Management, Test Automation Management, Automated
Deployment, Build and Release Management and more, all implemented in code, and all in PHP.
